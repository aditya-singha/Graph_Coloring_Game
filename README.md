## Project 1-1. Team 28

Welcome to our Graph Coloring Project. Here you can find instructions on how to run our code, folder structure, and additional code information.

## How to run our code

In order to run our code, you must have downloaded JavaFX. The project has been developed using this path for JavaFX C:/Program Files/Java/javafx-sdk-23.0.1/lib. You need to adjust it according to your computer Program Files architecture. The changes must happen in both files launch.json and settings.json. Additionally, under Java Projects, you will have to go in Referenced Libraries of our projects and add all the files mentioned inside the settings.json file.

After this, you have to go to the file Main.java and click the Play Button. You can enjoy our game.

## Additional Code

In the src folder, you can see a folder AdditionalCode. This is code that was completed and submitted at the day of submission. However, it has not been integrated inside the final product. Usually, to check the correctness of a code, we need more time than to write it.
